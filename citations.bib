	doi = {10.1109/APEC.2014.6803344},
	abstract = {Intel's® 4th generation Core™ microprocessors are powered by Fully Integrated Voltage Regulators (FIVR). These 140 MHz multi-phase buck regulators are integrated into the 22nm processor die, and feature up to 80 MHz unity gain bandwidth, non-magnetic package trace inductors and on-die MIM capacitors. FIVRs are highly configurable, allowing them to power a wide range of products from 3W fanless tablets to 300W servers. FIVR helps enable 50\% or more battery life improvements for mobile products and more than doubles the peak power available for burst workloads.},
