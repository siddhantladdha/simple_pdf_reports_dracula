# Usage

This indicates a Template report for generating beautiful PDF reports, beamer slides from Markdown and/or Jupyter Notebooks.
The theme used here is Dracula for everything. You can use this for generating simple pdf reports for labs, assignments
and stuff using markdown as source.
Markdown is easy and you can follow a [tutorial](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to use it and just use this as a template to
start writing actual content.

To actually make report just finally run `make report`. And yes you do need pandoc, LaTex etc. all the shebang to be
installed.
