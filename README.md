# Usage

This indicates a Template report for generating beautiful PDF reports, beamer slides from Markdown and/or Jupyter Notebooks.
The theme used here is Dracula for everything. You can use this for generating simple pdf reports for labs, assignments
and stuff using markdown as source.
Markdown is easy and you can follow a [tutorial](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to use it and just use this as a template to
start writing actual content.

To make the report run the following.
1. Markdown to PDF: `make md2pdf`
2. Jupyter Notebook to PDF: `make ipynb2pdf`
And yes you do need pandoc, LaTex etc. all the shebang to be installed.
